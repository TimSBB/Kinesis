# Project Diary

## January


### Week 2 - 03.01. - 09.01: 
	• set up of kinect with vvvv 
	• started with fuse library exploration. 
	• First time using Max Msp. Added basic Audiorouting and osc communication with vvvv
	• Had problems with slitscan/ringbuffer implementation -> solved
	• For further exploration, had to build nuget from source -> unsolved
	• researched some more on time and space

### Week 3 - 10.01. - 16.01.: 
	• For further exploration, had to build nuget from source -> solved
	• Timeline library is outdated -> unsolved
	• added body masking for kinect input

### Week 4 - 17.01. - 23.01.: 
	• build my own basic timeline tool -> solved
	• implemented optical flow on GPU
	• mutliple useres working for viusals, no multiple users for audio yet

### Week 5 - 24.01. - 30.01.: 
	• foucused more on understanding shaders in general (based on TBAG)
	• dove deeper into music production, need to get more into MaxMSP
	• switched with week 6 (tried to finish TBAG final project, not done yet)

## February

### Week 6 - 31.01. - 06.02.:
	• 31.01. - Got Kinect Utils from Ari!
	• worked further on TBAG final project -> done
	• started with Creative Coding Project -> Trained Machine Learning Model

### Week 7 - 07.02. - 13.02.:
	• restarted with another final project for Creative Coding with Three.js and got it pretty much done
### Week 8 - 14.02. - 20.02.:
	• started the setup of a proper system
	• implemented state machine
	• implemented individual timelines

### Week 9 - 21.02. - 27.02.:
	• cleaned up messy patches
	• added particle system to system -> uploading new particle systems on state switch not seamless
	• started setting up a global particle system with switchable rendering techniques and force additions
	• added optical flow 3D 
	• considering secundary particle system for background 
	• no secundary particle system needed -> solved

## March 

### Week 10 - 28.02. - 06.03.:
	▪ ringbuffer too heavy in combination -> added writing snaps to disk -> solved
	▪ 28.02.22: Complete Visual System up and running!
	▪ fixed optical flow
	▪ added secundary particle system for interaction with body representation
	▪ started with ambient sound generation in MaxMsp
	▪ added VSTs and connected ambient to kinect input
### Week 11 - 07.03. - 11.03.:
